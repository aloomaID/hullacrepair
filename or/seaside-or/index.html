                    <h2>Why is my AC not cooling properly?</h2>
                    <p>Is your air conditioner failing to cool your home in Seaside Oregon ? It can be frustrating, especially during the sweltering summer months. At Hull AC Repair, we understand how crucial a well-functioning AC is for your comfort. If your AC isn’t cooling properly, there are several potential causes.<br>A common issue is a dirty air filter. When the filter is clogged, airflow becomes restricted, causing the unit to struggle in cooling your space. Replacing or cleaning the filter can often restore your AC’s efficiency. Another culprit could be low refrigerant levels. Refrigerant is essential for absorbing heat and producing cool air. If there’s a leak or the levels are too low, your AC won't cool effectively.<br>The problem might also lie with the thermostat settings. Ensure that the thermostat is set to "cool" and the temperature is lower than the current room temperature. Sometimes, a failing compressor or dirty condenser coils could be at fault. The compressor is the heart of the system, and when it malfunctions, cooling is compromised.<br>Don’t let a malfunctioning AC disrupt your comfort in Seaside Oregon . At Hull AC Repair, we offer expert AC repair services across all cities in Seaside Oregon . Our trained technicians can quickly diagnose and fix the issue, ensuring your home stays cool and comfortable. Contact us today for reliable, same-day AC repair services!</p>
