                    <h2>Why is my AC not cooling properly?</h2>
                    <p>If your AC is not cooling properly, it can be incredibly frustrating, especially during the hottest months in Garfield New Jersey . Several issues might cause your air conditioner to underperform. One of the most common reasons is a clogged air filter. When filters get dirty, they restrict airflow, making it harder for the system to cool your home efficiently. Regular filter maintenance can prevent this issue and ensure consistent cooling.<br>Another potential problem is low refrigerant levels. Your AC needs the correct amount of refrigerant to effectively cool your space. A leak in the system can cause a drop in refrigerant levels, leading to warmer air and higher energy bills. Hull AC Repair in Garfield New Jersey  offers professional inspections to detect and fix refrigerant leaks, restoring your AC's optimal performance.<br>Your AC’s evaporator coils could also be dirty or frozen, hindering the cooling process. Dirt on the coils limits heat absorption, making it difficult for your system to cool the air properly. Regular cleaning by experts from Hull AC Repair ensures your coils stay in top condition.<br>If you notice that your AC struggles to maintain a cool temperature, it's time to call in the professionals. Hull AC Repair provides fast and reliable AC repair services across all cities in Garfield New Jersey . Don't wait until a small problem becomes a costly repair—contact us today for an expert diagnosis and efficient solutions.</p>
