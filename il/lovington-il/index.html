                    <h2>Why is my AC not cooling properly?</h2>
                    <p>If your AC is not cooling properly in Lovington Illinois Hull AC Repair is here to help you understand and fix the issue. Several factors can lead to this frustrating problem, impacting your home's comfort. One common reason is a dirty or clogged air filter. When filters aren't cleaned or replaced regularly, they restrict airflow, causing your AC to struggle in maintaining a cool environment.<br>Another possible cause is low refrigerant levels. Your AC system relies on refrigerant to absorb heat and cool your space. If there’s a leak, the refrigerant drops, leading to inadequate cooling. Detecting and repairing these leaks requires professional expertise to ensure efficient AC performance.<br>Thermostat issues can also contribute to this problem. A faulty thermostat might not send the correct signals to your AC unit, resulting in poor cooling. Lastly, your AC's condenser coils could be dirty. When these coils are covered in dust or debris, they can’t effectively release heat, reducing the cooling capacity of your AC.<br>At Hull AC Repair, we specialize in diagnosing and resolving all types of AC problems across Lovington Illinois . From filter replacements to refrigerant refills, our team ensures your AC operates at peak performance. Don't let the summer heat overwhelm you—contact Hull AC Repair for a thorough AC checkup and get your cooling system back to optimal condition today!</p>
