                    <h2>Why is my AC not cooling properly?</h2>
                    <p>If your AC isn't cooling properly in Centerville Georgia it can be frustrating, especially in the heat. Several issues could be the culprit behind your system's poor performance. At Hull AC Repair, we have seen these problems across all cities in Centerville Georgia and we’re here to help.<br>One of the most common reasons for inefficient cooling is a dirty or clogged air filter. When air filters are clogged, they block airflow, causing the system to work harder while delivering less cool air. Another potential cause is low refrigerant levels. Without enough refrigerant, your AC cannot effectively cool the air, often resulting in warm or mildly cool airflow. Leaks in the refrigerant line can cause these levels to drop, requiring prompt professional attention.<br>Additionally, faulty compressors or broken fan motors can significantly reduce cooling efficiency. These parts are responsible for pushing cool air throughout your home, and if they're damaged, the system may run but fail to cool.<br>Finally, if the system is cycling on and off too quickly, it could be an issue with the thermostat settings or capacitors, both of which need professional diagnostics.<br>If you're experiencing these issues or any other AC problems, Hull AC Repair provides expert AC services across Centerville Georgia  to restore your system’s cooling efficiency. Don’t let the heat get you down—contact us today for reliable solutions!</p>
